This is my response to the Engineering Challenge - https://github.com/peck/engineering-assessment?tab=readme-ov-file

Reviewing the links supplied at the bottom of the challenge, I noticed that the page at https://data.sfgov.org/Economy-and-Community/Mobile-Food-Facility-Permit/rqzj-sfat/data had a tab for Developers - https://www.sf.gov/resource/2023/open-data-developer-resources

So I'm choosing to NOT reinvent the wheel of creating a database.
I'll use API requests to request data as needed.

My vision is a mobile app that plots the food trucks on a map of San Francisco
and a search interface that allows the user to filter the food trucks displayed,
based on:
- truck or push cart
- type of food (taco, seafood, etc)
- is current time within hours of operation

I'm going to use python.

Since I've never written a mobile app, this is quite a stretch goal.

# Future enhancements:
- supply walking directions to selected food truck
